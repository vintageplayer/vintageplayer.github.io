I shut down my first company in Oct’21. We were building first, unprepared, listening to folks who weren’t our ideal customers and investors. The core things learned retrospectively:

1. **Sell first, build later:** Focus on building accurate user personas first. And talking to sufficient users before building anything.
2. **Be Patient**: Things take time to pan out. Once you actually zero down on the building, it could take 6-12 months to see the impact and meaningful adoption.
3. **JTBD:** Focus on solving/improving existing user behavior patterns. A new behavior pattern created by a new tech could be transient. Disruptive technologies usually still help with the same jobs to be done, just in a better manner.
4. **Funding is the wrong goal:** Don’t focus on picking up VC funding. Focus on getting the user profile and product right and forming mutually beneficial partnerships to grow through.
5. **Take Decisive Control:** There’s no concept called “soft-raising”. Get fundraising done in a pre-defined time period, whether successful or not, and go back to the building

Incase you are not sure about one or more of these, my recommended books would help with a pragmatic method of tackling the specific areas.
