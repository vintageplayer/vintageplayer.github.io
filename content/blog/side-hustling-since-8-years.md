In Noida, India, a well-fed kid from a middle-class working family with strict focus on education and nothing else, I'm not entirely how the desire to earn money kicks in.

### Finance of a Kid
**Pocket Money:** At this point I had ₹1/day as pocket my money.

**Cost of Snacks:**
 - A lays packet (or cheetos, my favorite was ₹10). 
 - A small coke or pepsi bottle was ₹7.
 - A snack item was ₹7-10, while a fancier dish in the school canteen would be ₹20-25

## Side Hustles

### 8 years old, My first earning: ₹120
- Two friends and I, the three musketeers, setup a games stall at a local community event, that got me my first ₹150. We were not very well prepared, and were shy, being the only stall, asking people for money. That ₹150 was gone in a week of me treating family over my first earned cash. We realised that was not the right market for the product :D

### 10 years old, Understood Better with a Partner: ₹1,050
- 2 years later, along with a friend, we setup the game stall in the Diwali Local Community Fair. Now, we had the right market. We were better prepared and had a bunch of different games planned. We setup multiple games like Hit The Glass, Lucky 7, Drop the coin in the bucket and charged ₹10 per attempt, returning double if they were successful. Towards the end, we each walked away with ₹1,050+ each in net profit. I felt rich. More cash than I need for 6 months easily.

### 11 years old, Went Solo: ₹2200
- I took the bold move doing the games stall solo next year, having learnt from previous experience. It was tougher to manage on my own, so I got part-time support from my sister, who I paid ₹500 from the earnings. I still netted roughly double of my last years earnings. My savings were increasing.

### 12 years old, Side-Opportunity: ₹400 at 1600% profit
- Moved to Bangalore. New city, school locality. We had just started using Gel Pens instead of Pencils. Kids in 7th grade discovered a way to shoot refills from the pen using a rubber band. Everyone had Gel Pens, few rubber bands were available in a class room. Et Voila. I bought a huge packet of rubber band from the stationary shop outside school for ₹25. I bought a pack of small celophene packets for ₹5. And I packed 10 rubbers band in each pack and started selling the small packs in the classroom for ₹5/each. Not my proudest hustle, but hay, it was some sweet, easy profit. And I was giving my classmates the fun they wanted. 

### 13 years old, Optimized Operations: ₹5,300
- New locallity in Bangalore, a place where they do celebrate Diwali with a Market fair. I ran a very optimized one-man shop with showmanship. Kept only two games which made the most money, helped streamline customer interaction efforts. My now I knew how to keep a customer hooked after a turn to make keep making them play. I had an unbelievable profit of ₹5k+. I probably was the richest 8th grader in school at that time, with full discresioary spending power.

### 15 years old, Earning Online: Earned & Sold 5 Bitcoins for $5
- I started teaching myself C/C++, HTML & Javascript in 10th grade. In eleventh, I started finding forums online to freelance. I also tried multiple pay-to-click sites, which I'm pretty sure were scammy. Tried making youtube videos, creating content gate-locked behind bit.fly ad links to generate cash and signed up on elance (before upwork had merged with it). One gig, eventually paid me 5 bitcoins, which I immediately sold for $5 dollars. That was good enough for a 15 year knowing not better.

### 19 years old, Freelancing Online: $60 in 4 hours
- Bored in college, I again started looking for tech work online to leverage my programming abilities. I landed one web scraping job on upwork which I did in 4 hours and the generous soul paid a $10 extra being happy with my work. But the whole repeatedly chasing new clients for short-term work seemed like a lot of overhead.

### 20 years old, Tech Interning: $150/month for learning
- I started looking for part-time internships, as my college didn't officially support one and I wanted industry experience. I ended up impressing this 2-man startup in TechPharma space. The CEO was non-tech and CTO was part-time, so I got a lot of work which I enjoyed as I was researching solving new problems. And I was getting paid. Now, a steady ₹11,000/month for part-time work. The 5-6 other people in my entire college who had mangaged to even get an internship, didn't breach ₹3,000/month. So I was well flushed in my college days.
