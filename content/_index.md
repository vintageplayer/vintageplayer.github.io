Hi! I'm **Aditya**. I enjoy strategy & game theory discussions. Taught myself programming at the age of 13 while I was entering high school in India. Now I think of myself as a generalist programmer, and budding tech entrepreneur at the age of 26.

I also love to play [soccer](https://www.arsenal.com/). I also enjoying going to *West-Coast Swing dance socials* and *surfing* a couple of times a year.

## Me in one Paragraph
I'm the co-founder at [JiffyLabs](https://jiffyscan.xyz/), working on niche-data API infra in the blockchain world. After it's launch in Apr'23, it grew 28% MoM in usage till September'23. During which period, our fully-bootstrapped company also generated $200k as revenue. We remain a 2-man team as of September'23.

My first startup failed, the second one I think of as a mini-sucess. Both taught a lot. I'm still 26, and definitely got a couple more decades of being a founder in me.

Hope you checkout my experiences from [the journey](/5_min_journey).
