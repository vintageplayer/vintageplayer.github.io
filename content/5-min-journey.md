## Notoriety of a Kid
- Multiple [(not-so) get-rich-quick side-hustles](/blog/side-hustling-since-8-years/) since I was 8 years old.
- Self-taught core systems-level programming at 13.
- Later explored different online earning avenues. (Sold 5 Bitcoins for $5 at the age of 15 years :D)
- Lacking a real interest in higher education, started my computer science from an average college in India in 2014.

## Becoming a generalist techie
### Outgrowing my College Environment
- Computers & their language came naturally to me. College studies were slow for my taste. I needed a more challenging environment.
- Joined as the youngest research assistant for the most chased-after professor in the institute. Within 3 months, I was leading a team of 12 peers for data curation and data modeling of [scientometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientometrics) data.
- While I helped with 2 research papers, the areas were not of my interest and I wasn't learning sufficiently.
- Tried cajoling my classmates to participate in different hackathons and building for a semester.
- In the start of my 3rd year, joined as the tech-intern for a 2 man startup. I was working after college and on weekends. Learnt a lot.
- I got awarded **[Brightest Engineer in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/etcampusstars/etcs2017-18)** by Economic Times, 33 among 17,000+ students who applied. (The only time my name was printed on a National News Paper)

### Working at MNC and a Unicorn Startup 
- Had a job offer before final year started. I was to join as a well-paid Data Scientist, a year later in 2018. And an year is a long time...
- Company was sold before I joined, data scientist department was removed from India and I joined the Data & BI Platform team. 2 weeks in, the manager left and a fellow fresher and I owned the whole stack responsible for the whole reporting: sales, support, FPNA, even for Nasdaq filing.
- After 3 months of fire-fighting, the system was stable and we started focusing on newer reporting projects, albeit lacking a strong technical mentor.
- After having multiple offers from MNCs (like Goldman Sachs), I decided startups felt more at home and joined as the first data-engineer at [Zeta](https://www.zeta.tech/), a banking-tech startup, a Unicorn by the time I left.
- Within a year, I had a promotion, had figured out the art to design and implement scalable data-platforms and deployed 4 new products during my time there. The data team now had 14 people, though my learning curve was plateauing.

## Tech Entrepreneur
### Decision
- In Apr'21, at the age of 24, I was choosing between two offers:
  - A 6-figure dollar salary in Disney+Hotstar in India with a promotion to senior engineer.
  - Undergoing talent accelerator [Enterpreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) for a chance at building my own company
  Every person I talked to, told me to take the first route, so I knew I had to take second to find out what happens.
### First Company, 2 accelerators & Shutting Down
- In [EF](https://www.joinef.com/), I was selected as a tech-founder, though I couldn't find a strong enough business leader for my taste. I switched and started pitchin to other techies to partner with me. [One agreed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautam-sabhahit-8a7835100/).
- In honesty, I entered blockchain through him. We did pick up funding on EF's BA6 batch and went on to join the [Tachyon Web3 Accelerator](https://tachyon.xyz/), backed by [Protcol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) and [Consensys Mesh](https://www.mesh.xyz/).
- We pivoted across ideas, very early for the market, but not real long-term markets in itself, speaking retrospectively.
- In Oct'22, I decided to shut down the company. We had burnt $60k and returned the funds.

### Hiatus and JiffyScan
- Selected by [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) my as scholar to Devcon in Oct'22. So I took the all expense paid trip to Bogota, Colombia and ended up stayin there for 3 months, probably away from family, while doing grant work for [Uniswap Foundation](https://www.uniswapfoundation.org/).
- In March'23, we started working fulltime on [JiffyScan](https://jiffyscan.xyz/). After it's launch in Apr'23, it grew 28% MoM in usage till September'23. During which period, our fully-bootstrapped company also generated $200k as revenue. We remain a 2-man team as of October'23.
- JiffyScan is a market-leader in a niche, albeit high growth revenue making opportunities have enough players. We decided to keep it as a lifestyle business, as the operational cost of the tool is now <$200/month and I didn't want to get acquired by other companies.

### Current Work
- After nearly 2.5 years away from any ML work, I'm started exploring LLMs in Oct'23 and various jobs to be done that can be improved signficantly, both in terms of cost and quality.
