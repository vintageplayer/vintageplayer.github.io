      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Aditya. After working for 3 years designing and developing Data Platforms, I took a shot at entrepreneurship.
I like to think it was in my genes, evident by my (not-so) get-rich-quick schemes before I started coding professionally.
I&amp;rsquo;m the co-founder at JiffyLabs , working on niche-data API infra in the blockchain world. After it&amp;rsquo;s launch in Apr&#39;23, it grew 28% MoM in usage till September&#39;23. During which period, our fully-bootstrapped company also generated $200k as revenue.</description>
