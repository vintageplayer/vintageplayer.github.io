I like to think it was in my genes, evident by my (not-so) get-rich-quick schemes before I started coding professionally.
I&rsquo;m the co-founder at JiffyLabs, working on niche-data API infra in the blockchain world. After it&rsquo;s launch in Apr&#39;23, it grew 28% MoM in usage till September&#39;23. During which period, our fully-bootstrapped company also generated $200k as revenue." />

<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Aditya. After working for 3 years designing and developing Data Platforms, I took a shot at entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>I like to think it was in my genes, evident by my <a href="/blog/side-hustling-since-8-years/">(not-so) get-rich-quick schemes</a> before I started coding professionally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the co-founder at <a href="https://jiffyscan.xyz/">JiffyLabs</a>, working on niche-data API infra in the blockchain world. After it&rsquo;s launch in Apr'23, it grew 28% MoM in usage till September'23. During which period, our fully-bootstrapped company also generated $200k as revenue. We remain a 2-man team as of September'23.</p>
<p>My first startup failed, the second one I think of as a mini-sucess. Both taught a lot. I&rsquo;m still 26, and definitely got a couple more decades of being a founder in me.</p>
<p>Hope you checkout my experiences from the journey.</p>
