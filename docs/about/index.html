</a>, working on niche-data API infra in the blockchain world. After it&rsquo;s launch in Apr'23, it grew 28% MoM in usage till September'23. During which period, our fully-bootstrapped company also generated $200k as revenue. We remain a 2-man team as of September'23.</p>
<p>My first startup failed, the second one I think of as a mini-sucess. Both taught a lot. I&rsquo;m still 26, and definitely got a couple more decades of being a founder in me.</p>
<p>Hope you checkout my experiences from the journey.</p>
