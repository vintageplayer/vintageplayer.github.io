<h3 id="finance-of-a-kid">Finance of a Kid</h3>
<p><strong>Pocket Money:</strong> At this point I had ₹1/day as pocket my money.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of Snacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A lays packet (or cheetos, my favorite was ₹10).</li>
<li>A small coke or pepsi bottle was ₹7.</li>
<li>A snack item was ₹7-10, while a fancier dish in the school canteen would be ₹20-25</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="side-hustles">Side Hustles</h2>
<h3 id="8-years-old-my-first-earning-120">8 years old, My first earning: ₹120</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two friends and I, the three musketeers, setup a games stall at a local community event, that got me my first ₹150. We were not very well prepared, and were shy, being the only stall, asking people for money. That ₹150 was gone in a week of me treating family over my first earned cash. We realised that was not the right market for the product :D</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="10-years-old-understood-better-with-a-partner-1050">10 years old, Understood Better with a Partner: ₹1,050</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 years later, along with a friend, we setup the game stall in the Diwali Local Community Fair. Now, we had the right market. We were better prepared and had a bunch of different games planned. We setup multiple games like Hit The Glass, Lucky 7, Drop the coin in the bucket and charged ₹10 per attempt, returning double if they were successful. Towards the end, we each walked away with ₹1,050+ each in net profit. I felt rich. More cash than I need for 6 months easily.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-years-old-went-solo-2200">11 years old, Went Solo: ₹2200</h3>
<ul>
<li>I took the bold move doing the games stall solo next year, having learnt from previous experience. It was tougher to manage on my own, so I got part-time support from my sister, who I paid ₹500 from the earnings. I still netted roughly double of my last years earnings. My savings were increasing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-years-old-side-opportunity-400-at-1600-profit">12 years old, Side-Opportunity: ₹400 at 1600% profit</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moved to Bangalore. New city, school locality. We had just started using Gel Pens instead of Pencils. Kids in 7th grade discovered a way to shoot refills from the pen using a rubber band. Everyone had Gel Pens, few rubber bands were available in a class room. Et Voila. I bought a huge packet of rubber band from the stationary shop outside school for ₹25. I bought a pack of small celophene packets for ₹5. And I packed 10 rubbers band in each pack and started selling the small packs in the classroom for ₹5/each. Not my proudest hustle, but hay, it was some sweet, easy profit. And I was giving my classmates the fun they wanted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-years-old-optimized-operations-5300">13 years old, Optimized Operations: ₹5,300</h3>
<ul>
<li>New locallity in Bangalore, a place where they do celebrate Diwali with a Market fair. I ran a very optimized one-man shop with showmanship. Kept only two games which made the most money, helped streamline customer interaction efforts. My now I knew how to keep a customer hooked after a turn to make keep making them play. I had an unbelievable profit of ₹5k+. I probably was the richest 8th grader in school at that time, with full discresioary spending power.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="15-years-old-earning-online-earned--sold-5-bitcoins-for-5">15 years old, Earning Online: Earned &amp; Sold 5 Bitcoins for $5</h3>
<ul>
<li>I started teaching myself C/C++, HTML &amp; Javascript in 10th grade. In eleventh, I started finding forums online to freelance. I also tried multiple pay-to-click sites, which I&rsquo;m pretty sure were scammy. Tried making youtube videos, creating content gate-locked behind bit.fly ad links to generate cash and signed up on elance (before upwork had merged with it). One gig, eventually paid me 5 bitcoins, which I immediately sold for $5 dollars. That was good enough for a 15 year knowing not better.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="19-years-old-freelancing-online-60-in-4-hours">19 years old, Freelancing Online: $60 in 4 hours</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bored in college, I again started looking for tech work online to leverage my programming abilities. I landed one web scraping job on upwork which I did in 4 hours and the generous soul paid a $10 extra being happy with my work. But the whole repeatedly chasing new clients for short-term work seemed like a lot of overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="20-years-old-tech-interning-150month-for-learning">20 years old, Tech Interning: $150/month for learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>I started looking for part-time internships, as my college didn&rsquo;t officially support one and I wanted industry experience. I ended up impressing this 2-man startup in TechPharma space. The CEO was non-tech and CTO was part-time, so I got a lot of work which I enjoyed as I was researching solving new problems. And I was getting paid. Now, a steady ₹11,000/month for part-time work. The 5-6 other people in my entire college who had mangaged to even get an internship, didn&rsquo;t breach ₹3,000/month. So I was well flushed in my college days.</li>
